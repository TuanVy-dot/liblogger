#Liblogger

`liblogger` is a lightweight and ease of use C logging library (hence not the most efficient). It support coloring using ANSI escape sequences, log levels and multiple loggers. With a little set up, it can be ready to use.

current version: 2.0.0
I will soon provide documentations

#Installation
Get the source and install by yourself, it is the most portable way I can think about.

Note that I did not check for any compatibility, there could be a problem with it.

#Usage
The usage is fairly simple, all you have to do is declare a LOGGER pointer, initialize using logger_create() and some optional additional configurations and it is done. See documentation in loggerdocs.md
